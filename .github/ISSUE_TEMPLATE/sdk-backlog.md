## 📚 SDK Implementation Backlog

### 🎯 **Objective**
Implement Guardian-AA SDK in additional programming languages to expand developer ecosystem reach.

### ✅ **Completed SDKs**
- [x] **TypeScript/JavaScript SDK** - ✅ Production ready (v0.1.0)
  - 🔐 Zero-knowledge proof integration
  - ⚡ Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)  
  - 🚫 Gasless transactions
  - 🔗 Multi-signature wallets
  - 📦 NPM package published

### 🔄 **Planned SDK Implementations**

#### 🦀 **Rust SDK** 
**Priority: High** | **Phase: 4**
- [ ] Core SDK structure and configuration
- [ ] Zero-knowledge proof client (native Halo2 integration)
- [ ] Smart contract interaction via ethers-rs
- [ ] Account abstraction support
- [ ] Multi-signature wallet functionality
- [ ] Gasless transaction support
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Crates.io package publishing

**Benefits:**
- Native performance for ZK proof operations
- Direct integration with guardian_zkml Rust prover
- Appeal to Rust blockchain developers
- Cross-compilation for various targets

#### 🐍 **Python SDK**
**Priority: Medium** | **Phase: 4-5**
- [ ] Core SDK structure using web3.py
- [ ] Zero-knowledge proof client (FFI to Rust)
- [ ] Account abstraction wrapper
- [ ] Multi-signature support
- [ ] Transaction building utilities  
- [ ] Async/await support
- [ ] Type hints and mypy compatibility
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with pytest
- [ ] PyPI package publishing

**Benefits:**
- Appeal to data science and DeFi researchers
- Integration with Jupyter notebooks
- Machine learning workflow compatibility
- Broader Python developer ecosystem

#### 🔮 **Future Considerations**
- **Go SDK** - For backend services and infrastructure
- **Swift SDK** - Native iOS mobile development
- **Kotlin SDK** - Native Android mobile development
- **C# SDK** - Enterprise and Unity game development

### 🏗️ **Implementation Guidelines**

#### **Core Requirements:**
1. **Consistent API Surface**: Match TypeScript SDK patterns where possible
2. **Error Handling**: Language-idiomatic error management
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs with examples
4. **Testing**: 90%+ coverage with integration tests
5. **Performance**: Optimize for language-specific patterns
6. **Packaging**: Follow language ecosystem standards

#### **Architecture Patterns:**
```
Language SDK/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Main GuardianAA client
│   ├── zk/            # Zero-knowledge proof client
│   ├── contracts/     # Smart contract interactions
│   ├── utils/         # Utilities and helpers
│   └── types/         # Type definitions
├── tests/             # Comprehensive test suite
├── examples/          # Usage examples
└── docs/              # API documentation
```

### 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Feature parity with TypeScript SDK
- [ ] Language-idiomatic APIs and patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Published package in language ecosystem
- [ ] Example applications demonstrating usage
